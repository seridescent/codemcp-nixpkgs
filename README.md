# codemcp-nix

Quick and dirty Nix package definition for [codemcp](https://github.com/ezyang/codemcp), a coding assistant MCP for Claude Desktop.

Not working on upstreaming to nixpkgs because: 
1. uncertain if codemcp meets inclusion criteria
2. tests are disabled lol
3. also requires packaging `agno` dependency, which I'm not very interested in doing right now
